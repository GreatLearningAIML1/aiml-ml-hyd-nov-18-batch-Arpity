    "a.\tRemove unwanted characters\n",

    "b.\tConvert text to lowercase\n",
    "\n",
    "c.\tRemove unwanted spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "d.\tRemove stopwords\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tAs we want to make this into a multi-label classification problem, you are required to merge all the label columns together, so that we have all the labels together for a particular sentence (7.5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "a.\tLabel columns to merge: “gender”, “age”, “topic”, “sign”\n",
    "b.\tAfter completing the previous step, there should be only two columns in your data frame i.e. “text” and “labels” as shown in the below image\n",

    "b.\tPrint the term-document matrix\n",

    "\n",
    "7. Transform the labels - (7.5 points)\n",
    "As we have noticed before, in this task each example can have multiple tags. To deal with such kind of prediction, we need to transform labels in a binary form and the prediction will be a mask of 0s and 1s. For this purpose, it is convenient to use MultiLabelBinarizer from sklearn\n",

As a basic classifier, use LogisticRegression. It is one of the simplest methods, but often it performs good enough in text classification tasks. It might take some time because the number of classifiers to train is large.\n",

Since each class is represented by one and one classifier only, it is possible to gain knowledge about the class by inspecting its corresponding classifier. This is the most commonly used strategy for multiclass classification and is a fair default choice.\n",
